# What is scholarly podcasting?

- Podcasting is distributing audio online
- Scholarly podcasting discusses academic ideas for an interested public​

# Common podcast formats

## Presenter​

One or more researchers present their work as a podcast​

## Interview​

An interviewer asks one or more scholars questions about their research​

## Panel

Three or more academics in related fields discuss their work​. One usually moderates, but not necessarily.

# Getting started

- Listen to scholarly podcasts to identify what you **like**
- Think about your **audience**
- What would they **like** to hear?

# Preparing an episode

- Decide on the episode's theme
- Arrange for any guests
- Prepare for interviews

# Recording

- When recording, the environment should be *quiet*, and the microphone needs to be *well placed*.
- A closet full of clothes is likely the quietest place you have to record. Even [NPR](https://training.npr.org/2020/03/31/professional-sound-from-a-diy-studio-it-can-be-done/) uses this trick.
- You can get started with the microphone on your phone or computer.
- If they are in a different location, you will also need to help your guests record themselves.

## iOS

The default [Voice Memos](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/make-a-recording-iph4d2a39a3b/ios) app works well

## Android

Androids come with a voice recorder, but the name varies depending on your phone's manufacturer. Search for "record" in the App Drawer.

# Recording tips

- Listen to a sample of your recording *before* starting the interview
- Clap at the beginning to synchronize multiple audio files
- Avoid clipping
- Maintain a consistent distance from the microphone
- Pause the conversation to drink water or make noise (e.g. shuffling papers)
- Get another take if someone says something poorly, or you hear noise
- You can always re-record yourself; you can't re-record guests

# Editing

This is where you cook the raw audio of your interview into a podcast.

Apple's [GarageBand](https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/) and [Audacity](https://audacityteam.org/) are two popular digital audio editors.

Audacity is free, open-source, and cross-platform. GarageBand comes with Macs.

# Principles of editing

- Just because they said it doesn't mean you have to keep it
- Put it in the order that makes sense, not the order it happened in
- Cut tangents
- Clarity, clarity, clarity

## Audio from iPhones

If you record your voice on an iPhone, you may need to install the [FFmpeg library](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/faq_installation_and_plug_ins.html#How_do_I_download_and_install_the_FFmpeg_Import.2FExport_Library.3F) for Audacity to be able to read those files.

# Audacity review

- Import recorded audio
- Cut the bad (select, delete)
- Mix the good (balance, normalize)

## A note about music

Music can help transition between introduction and interview.

You can find royalty-free music for download at the [Free Music Archive](https://freemusicarchive.org/).

# Podcast accessibility

For people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing, **transcripts** are essential.

See examples from [The Dig](https://thedigradio.com/transcripts/) and [CSN Café](https://novel.stanford.edu/csn-cafe).

# Sharing

Once editing is complete, export your podcast as an `.mp3` or `.wav` file. You can share that with people directly.

If you want to be on the main podcast plaforms, [Apple](https://podcasters.apple.com/) and [Spotify](https://podcasters.spotify.com/) each provide instructions for how to share your work.

# Practice!

1. Install Audacity (or use GarageBand if you'd rather)
2. Choose a partner (if you want one)
3. Choose a format for your podcast
4. Create a 2-minute episode about one of your **habits**: what you make for breakfast, how you write an essay, what you do to relax, etc.
5. What went wrong as you practiced? How could you improve it in the future?
